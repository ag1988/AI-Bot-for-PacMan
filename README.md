# AI_Bot_for_playing_PacMan
### Author : Ankit Gupta

Description : A deep convolutional neural net (CNN) for playing the well-known arcade game ‘Ms. Pac-Man’ trained using Q-learning (reinforcement learning). Game data is obtained using the ‘OpenAI Gym’. The neural net significantly outperforms all tried uniform-random strategies.

PacMan.ipynb : The python code in form of a Jupyter Notebook.

Demo Video : A few demos of the trained bot are available at .
