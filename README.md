# AI_Bot_for_playing_PacMan
### Author : Ankit Gupta

Description : A deep convolutional neural net (CNN) for playing the well-known arcade game ‘Ms. Pac-Man’ trained using Q-learning (reinforcement learning). Game data is obtained using the ‘OpenAI Gym’. The neural net significantly outperforms all tried uniform-random strategies. *We do not inject any prior knowledge* in the Q-nets. For instance, we do not explicitly use the distance from the ghosts - the system only has access to the game frames and has to learn everything by itself.

Python code in form of a Jupyter Notebook can be viewed [here](https://github.com/ag1988/AI_Bot_for_playing_PacMan/blob/master/PacMan.ipynb).
